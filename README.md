# SimpleMouseTracker
This is a basic gui to allow a user to track a mouse (or dark object) in an image. Designed for three chamber social assay but reasonably flexible to any environment that is lighter than the mouse. I should note that this code is not inefficient (*looks at spaghetti on wall*). 

Update: now uses a derivative algorithm ('derivative') to track animal movement on non-contrasting backgrounds. 

This code is largely taken from code I found online in 2017... can't track down the original location and no authors listed in the orignal code.
